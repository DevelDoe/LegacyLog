* (fives) if you mix it with heat mechanics and an input time you could get the best dps guess.
* (fives) I wonder if a "dps per shot landed" type of thing could be useful as well. Say with cannons where you might land 4/5 of shots but pick your shots every 3 seconds. Or repeaters where you land 2/3 of shots but fire at the max fire rate as opposed to individual shots.
* (fives) I just know with some patches such as the current one, effective dps is often higher with cannons because it is possible to land say every 3rd shot, where as with repeaters even 10% accuracy would be a stretch.
